# spock-rock-game
Game similar to Rock Paper Scissors and it's called Rock Paper Scissors Lizards Spock
If you had watched The Big Bang Theory a few years ago, they made a reference and they played this game on the show.
It's a slightly more complex version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, in that there are five possible choices.
So when we  hover over each of the icons, there's a title for each.
And how this game is going to work is the user will have the opportunity to click on one of these icons to select their weapon.
And then there will be logic that will allow the computer to make a random selection and then it will evaluate which player won 
or if they choose the same thing. If there is a tie between the player and the computer.
If we win then automatically the will go up
It shows my selection and also the computer selection
And it also highlights the icon in black for both of us.
And it even has the text down below here that lets us know that we won.
It actually resets the confetti and then started throwing it again for next round.
This project is also mobile, responsive.
And the last thing within the game itself is we have this reset icon that allows us to start the game
all the way over.
